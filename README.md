# Bamazon
creating an Amazon-like storefront with the Node.js and MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

It also works like an inventory management app which has Manager view and Supervisor view.

The app has 3 stand alone running files:
1. Customer.js (Customer View)
2. Manager.js (Manager View)
3. Supervisor.js (Supervisor View)

I Tried to write an App which runs using single javascript file (bamazon.js) which inturns call customer.js,manager.js and supervisor.js
But I could not complete it. I am still working on it.

<h4>Though the app works with all the stand alone files very fine!</h4>

Below are the Screen shots to show how the app works:
