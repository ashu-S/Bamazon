# Bamazon
creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

The app has 3 stand alone running files:
1. Customer.js (Customer View)
2. Manager.js (Manager View)
3. Supervisor.js (Supervisor View)

I Tried to write an App which runs using single javascript file (bamazon.js) which inturns call customer.js,manager.js and supervisor.js
But I could not complete it. I am still working on it.


Below are the Screen shots to show how the app works:
